## The basic idea:

Using the Discord.js API to catch user input and sending it to the gpt-3.5-turbo API for a ChatGPT response.  
Then, using the Discord.js API to send the AI's response in a Discord channel.

### Future ideas:
An adaptation of a Discord music bot (check guide here https://gabrieltanner.org/blog/dicord-music-bot/) and using the OpenAI Whisper API to turn speech into text and get a response from the ChatGPT API to output into a Discord channel.

Much further adaptation could be that a text-to-speech AI responds inside the call channel.
